    <p>Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau.
     There, legend says the goat herder <a href="# footer"><em>Kaldi <sup>[1]</sup></em></a>  first discovered the potential of these beloved beans. 

    The story goes that that  <em>kaldi</em> discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree,
     his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night. 
    
   <em>Kaldi</em> reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that it kept him alert
    through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing
     berries began to spread.
    
    As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which would bring these beans across the

   <p> The earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking or knowledge of the
    coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the accounts of
     Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen, where coffee seeds were first roasted and
      brewed in a similar way to how it is prepared now. Coffee was used by Sufi circles
       to stay awake for their religious rituals. Accounts differ on the origin 
       of the coffee plant before its appearance in Yemen. From Ethiopia, coffee could 
   have been introduced to Yemen via trade across the Red Sea. One account credits
     Muhammad Ibn Sa'd for bringing the beverage to Aden from the African coast,[14] other
     early accounts say Ali ben Omar of the Shadhili Sufi order was the first to introduce
     coffee to Arabia. According to al Shardi, Ali ben Omar may have encountered
    coffee during his stay with the Adal king Sadadin's companions in 1401.

    Famous 16th-century Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami notes in his writings that
     a beverage called qahwa developed from a tree in the Zeila region located in the Horn
      of Africa. Coffee was first exported from Ethiopia to Yemen by Somali merchants from 
      Berbera and Zeila in modern-day Somaliland, which was procured from Harar and the Abyssinian 
      interior. According to Captain Haines, who was the colonial administrator of Aden (1839–1854),
       Mocha historically imported up to two-thirds of their coffee from Berbera-based merchants before
        the coffee trade of Mocha was captured by British-controlled Aden in the 19th century. After that,
         much of the Ethiopian coffee was exported to Aden via Berbera.

<li><mark><a href="#"></a> ARABICA COFFEE :<SUP>2</SUP></mark> arabica also known as the Arabica coffee, 
    is a species of flowering plant in the coffee and madder family Rubiaceae. 
    It is believed to be the first species of coffee to have been cultivated and 
    is currently the dominant cultivar, representing about 60% of global production.
     Coffee produced from the less acidic, more bitter, and more highly
caffeinated robusta bean (C. canephora) makes up most of the remaining coffee 
production. The natural populations of Coffea arabica are restricted to the forests of South Ethiopia and Yemen.
</li>
<li><MARK><a href="#"></a>ROBOUSTA:<SUP>3</SUP></MARK></li>coffee canephora 
(esp. C. canephora var. robusta, so predominantly cultivated that it is often
 simply termed Coffea robusta, or commonly robusta coffee) is a species of coffee 
 that has its origins in central and western sub-Saharan Africa. It is a species of
  flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. Though widely known as Coffee robusta,
   the plant is scientifically identified as Coffea canephora, which has two main
    varieties, robusta and nganda.[2]

Coffee robusta represents between 40% and 45% of global coffee production

<li><MARK><a href="#"></a>EXCELSA:<SUP>4</SUP></MARK>Discovered in Africa at the
     turn of the 20th century, excelsa coffee is a unique, resilient, and productive
      species, despite its minimal presence in the global coffee market. Little 
      information about how much of it is traded, roasted, or brewed is available, 
      since it moves only in very small quantities. 

    Although excelsa has been widely cultivated and consumed for many years 
    in Africa and Asia, its origin is largely misunderstood. This means the
     beans are often not cultivated, processed, or roasted correctly, and are 
     summarily regarded as being low in cup quality with no distinctive flavour
      characteristics.
    
    However, much like robusta, when farmed and processed with care and precision,
     excelsa can yield beans with positive, desirable, and unique flavours. To
      learn more, I spoke with Dr. Oliveiro Guerreiro Filho from the Instituto 
      Agronômico de Campinas (IAC), and Komal Sable of South India Coffee Co. 
      Read on to find out what they told me.</li>
<li><mark> <a href="#"></a>LIBERICA:<SUP>5</SUP></mark>Coffea liberica accounts for
     less than 1.5% of commercial coffee grown. It was first commercially cultivated 
     in the Philippines, after it was brought to the city of Lipa in the 1740s by Spanish 
     friars. C. liberica was the main coffee species grown in the islands during the 
     colonial period. They were exported to Western countries where they would command
      prices of up to five times the prices of coffee beans from other species. During 
      the worldwide pandemic of coffee rust in the late 19th century, C. liberica 
      plantations in the Philippines survived longer than arabica and robusta plantations.
       But they too eventually succumbed to the disease, leading to the collapse of the 
       coffee industry in the islands.</li>

    <p>Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau.
     There, legend says the goat herder <a href="# footer"><em>Kaldi <sup>[1]</sup></em></a>  first discovered the potential of these beloved beans. 

    The story goes that that  <em>kaldi</em> discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree,
     his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night. 
    
   <em>Kaldi</em> reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that it kept him alert
    through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing
     berries began to spread.
    
    As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which would bring these beans across the globe.

<li><mark><a href="#"></a> ARABICA COFFEE <SUP>2</SUP></mark> arabica also known as the Arabica coffee, 
    is a species of flowering plant in the coffee and madder family Rubiaceae. 
    It is believed to be the first species of coffee to have been cultivated and 
    is currently the dominant cultivar, representing about 60% of global production.
     Coffee produced from the less acidic, more bitter, and more highly
caffeinated robusta bean (C. canephora) makes up most of the remaining coffee 
production. The natural populations of Coffea arabica are restricted to the forests of South Ethiopia and Yemen.
</li>
<li><MARK><a href="#"></a>ROBOUSTA<SUP>3</SUP></MARK></li>coffee canephora 
(esp. C. canephora var. robusta, so predominantly cultivated that it is often
 simply termed Coffea robusta, or commonly robusta coffee) is a species of coffee 
 that has its origins in central and western sub-Saharan Africa. It is a species of
  flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. Though widely known as Coffee robusta,
   the plant is scientifically identified as Coffea canephora, which has two main
    varieties, robusta and nganda.[2]

Coffee robusta represents between 40% and 45% of global coffee production

<li><MARK><a href="#"></a>EXCELSA <SUP>4</SUP></MARK>Discovered in Africa at the
     turn of the 20th century, excelsa coffee is a unique, resilient, and productive
      species, despite its minimal presence in the global coffee market. Little 
      information about how much of it is traded, roasted, or brewed is available, 
      since it moves only in very small quantities. 

    Although excelsa has been widely cultivated and consumed for many years 
    in Africa and Asia, its origin is largely misunderstood. This means the
     beans are often not cultivated, processed, or roasted correctly, and are 
     summarily regarded as being low in cup quality with no distinctive flavour
      characteristics.
    
    However, much like robusta, when farmed and processed with care and precision,
     excelsa can yield beans with positive, desirable, and unique flavours. To
      learn more, I spoke with Dr. Oliveiro Guerreiro Filho from the Instituto 
      Agron√¥mico de Campinas (IAC), and Komal Sable of South India Coffee Co. 
      Read on to find out what they told me.</li>
<li><mark> <a href="#"></a>LIBERICA <SUP>5</SUP></mark>Coffea liberica accounts for
     less than 1.5% of commercial coffee grown. It was first commercially cultivated 
     in the Philippines, after it was brought to the city of Lipa in the 1740s by Spanish 
     friars. C. liberica was the main coffee species grown in the islands during the 
     colonial period. They were exported to Western countries where they would command
      prices of up to five times the prices of coffee beans from other species. During 
      the worldwide pandemic of coffee rust in the late 19th century, C. liberica 
      plantations in the Philippines survived longer than arabica and robusta plantations.
       But they too eventually succumbed to the disease, leading to the collapse of the 
       coffee industry in the islands.</li>
